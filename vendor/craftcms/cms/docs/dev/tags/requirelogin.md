# `{% requireLogin %}` Tags

This tag will ensure that the user is logged in. If they arenâ€™t, they will be redirected to the Login page, and returned to the original page after successfully logging in.

```twig
{% requireLogin %}
```

You can place this tag anywhere in your template, including within a conditional. If/when Twig gets to it, the login enforcement will take place.

The URL that the logged-out users get redirected to is based on your <config:loginPath> config setting.
