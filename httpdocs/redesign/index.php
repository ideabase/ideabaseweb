		<p class="introduction">A retrospective on the process for the IdeaBase website redesign project, completed in Feb. 2016.</p>
		<h2>Business Needs & Competitive Analysis</h2>

		<h2>Visual Style Guide and Style Tiles</h2>
		<p>Nov. 2015 - Our designers documented our visual styles and came up with a set of colors and typography.  We also developed style tiles for the website that would help determine visual direction (was later turned into HTML/CSS).</p>

		<h2>Static Mockups</h2>
		<p>Dec. 2015 - We made static mockups of the home page and key components in Illustrator and then integrated them into the website prototype.</p>

		<h2>Usability Testing</h2>

		<h2>Production Website / Content Management System</h2>
		<p>Feb. 2016 - We planned content types and content modeled our fields and then developed a content management system to house the website.  We chose Craft CMS because of its focus on content structure and template flexibility.</p>

		<h2>Visual & Content Style Guide</h2>
		<p>March 2016 - After the website was launched, we got to work documenting the various content, colors, icons, typefaces and styles used to create the website.  We documented them in an online style guide, accessible to any future IdeaBase staff member who works on communications materials.</p>
