    <h2>Eye Tracking Usability</h2>
    <p>We offer both traditional desktop eye tracking as well as wearable eyetracking technologies from Tobii. Eye tracking allows our user experience designers to closely study your product to see exactly where users are (and aren’t) looking. Using this measurable data, we’re able to suggest user experience improvements that help your users complete their goals faster and easier.</p> 

	<h3>About Eye Tracking</h3>
    <p>Our eye tracking software can produce stunning visualizations, including heat maps and gaze plots, to help you communicate your findings to your stakeholders. It’s also a great tool for academic research. In fact, IdeaBase was featured in a national study on multimedia journalism by the Reynolds Journalism Institute.</p>
