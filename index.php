		<h2>Visual Style Guide and Style Tiles</h2>
		<p>Our designers documented our visual styles and came up with a set of colors and typography.  We also developed style tiles for the website that would help determine visual direction (was later turned into HTML/CSS).</p>

		<h2>Static Mockups</h2>
		<p>We made static mockups of the home page and key components in Illustrator and then integrated them into the website prototype.</p>

		<h2>Production Website / Content Management System</h2>
		<p>We planned content types and content modeled our fields and then developed a content management system to house the website.  We chose Craft CMS because of its focus on content structure and template flexibility.</p>
