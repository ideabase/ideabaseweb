        Put Your Design Skills to the Test

        At IdeaBase, we believe that all students should have the opportunity to gain real-world experience before graduating. Our student employees come from a variety of backgrounds and benefit from our comprehensive service offering.

        Our student employees are:
        part-time or full-time Kent State University students
        taking at least 6 credit hours
        who are passionate about design

        Our students are primarily from the College of Communication and Information, but we have team members from other majors as well.  Some of our past student majors include:
        Visual Communication Design
        Communication Studies
        Advertising
        Public Relations
        Journalism
        Computer Information Systems
        Computer Science
        User Experience Design
        Library & Information Science
        Digital Sciences
