<h2>A LEGACY OF STUDENT-LED DESIGN SOLUTIONS</h2>
<p>Formerly the Tannery, IdeaBase opened in 2009 as the brainchild of Jim Gaudino, the founding dean of the <a href="#">College of Communication and Information (CCI)</a>. Gaudino worked with the directors from each of the CCI schools to develop a vision for a student-staffed organization where students could receive hands-on experience.</p>
<p>In 2014, to better reflect its core mission of providing unique educational experiences while delivering quality design solutions, the Tannery transformed into IdeaBase. Within the same year, IdeaBase expanded its service offering with the addition of <a href="#">Glyphix</a>, a classroom studio experience from the <a href="#">School of Visual Communication Design</a>. IdeaBase continues to operate as part of the CCI, always evolving to bring new services and experiences to the university community and beyond.</p>
